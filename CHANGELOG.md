## [1.0.0] - 2024-12-06

### Added
- Initial release of Bedrock Load Testing Suite
- Foundation Model load testing with support for:
  - Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3.5 Haiku, Claude 3 Opus
  - Amazon Titan Text Express and Lite
  - Meta Llama 3.2 90B and 11B models
- Knowledge Base performance testing
- Comprehensive metrics collection:
  - Performance metrics (latency, throughput, success rates)
  - Cost tracking and analysis
  - System resource monitoring
  - Error analysis and reporting
- HTML report generation with visualizations
- CSV export for raw data analysis
- Demo test for quick validation
- Makefile for easy command execution
- Configurable test scenarios and parameters
- Concurrent user testing capabilities
- Retry logic and error handling
- AWS credentials validation
- Cost estimation and optimization guidance

### Features
- **Foundation Model Testing**:
  - Multiple concurrent user levels (1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100)
  - Various prompt types and complexities
  - Token usage tracking and cost calculation
  - Streaming response support
  - Model-specific request/response handling

- **Knowledge Base Testing**:
  - Query pattern analysis (factual, analytical, technical, etc.)
  - Session continuity testing
  - Citation analysis
  - OCU usage monitoring
  - Retrieval configuration testing

- **Metrics and Reporting**:
  - Real-time metrics collection
  - Performance visualizations
  - Cost breakdown analysis
  - Error pattern identification
  - System resource monitoring
  - HTML reports with charts and graphs

- **Configuration Management**:
  - YAML-based configuration files
  - Model-specific settings
  - Test parameter customization
  - Environment-specific configurations

### Documentation
- Comprehensive README with setup instructions
- Contributing guidelines
- MIT License
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- Makefile with common commands
- Configuration examples and templates

### Dependencies
- boto3 >= 1.34.0 for AWS SDK
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn for data analysis and visualization
- pyyaml for configuration management
- psutil for system monitoring
- aiohttp for async operations
- jinja2 for HTML report templating

### Configuration
- Default test duration: 300 seconds
- Default concurrent users: [1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100]
- Default request timeout: 30 seconds
- Configurable retry logic with exponential backoff
- Support for multiple AWS regions (default: us-east-1)

### Known Limitations
- Knowledge Base and Agent testing require manual configuration of IDs
- Batch inference testing not yet implemented
- Guardrails testing not yet implemented
- Limited to text-based models (no image/multimodal support yet)

### Security
- No hardcoded credentials
- Gitignore includes AWS credentials and sensitive files
- Security checks in CI pipeline
- Environment variable support for sensitive configuration
